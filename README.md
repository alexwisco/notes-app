Note taking app upgraded from a task in the fullstackopen.com course.

- updating UI and general design and implementing additional functionality (editing notes, better error catching).
- For the future: Priority of notes, customized themes for users, email notification settings on notes, different sorting options in a menu (time made, priority, alpha, etc)
